# Weather-app

A Weather dashboard that cleanly displays the current weather forecast and temperature along with the forecast and temperature for the next 4 days. The dashboard allows for users to search for regions based off city names and zipcodes to accurately show the weather for the searched city and dynamically change the background based on the weather forecast and time of day.

Technology:

The main focus of the dashboard was to use a free weather API to pull data based on the users search criteria.

Challenges:

The main hurdle that I needed to overcome with this project was the usage of asynchronous code. I main used fetch requests to solve this but using them in a real project gave me a deeper understanding of how they work and the benefits and limitations that come with them.
